## About Me

I am a Master’s student in the **Data Science & Artificial Intelligence** program at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/" target="_blank"><strong>TU Delft</strong></a>, working under the supervision of <a href="https://jvgemert.github.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Prof. Jan van Gemert</strong></a> in the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/computer-vision-lab" target="_blank"><strong>Computer Vision Lab</strong></a>. 

My current research focuses on fundamental ML and Deep learning, image segmentation, vision-language models, NLP , Gen AI and Agentic AI. I am also collaborating with <a href="http://rahnamayan.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Prof. Shahryar Rahnamayan</strong></a> (Brock University & Ontario Tech University) and <a href="https://www.wlu.ca/academics/faculties/faculty-of-science/faculty-profiles/azam-asilian-bidgoli/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>Prof. Azam Asilian Bidgoli</strong></a> (Wilfrid Laurier University, Canada) on projects involving **Natural Language Processing**, **evolutionary algorithms**, and **thresholding techniques for NLP embedding binarization**.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.mahindrauniversity.edu.in/" target="_blank"><strong>Mahindra University</strong></a>, India. During my undergrad I worked with Prof Neha Bharill, Prof Om Prakash Patel, Prof Rahul Roy and Prof Mahipal Jetta.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing and watching football and am a passionate <strong>FC Barcelona</strong> supporter and Messi fan. I also love to travel, enjoy music, and play both the tabla and keyboard.
