## About Me

I am a Master’s student in the **Data Science & Artificial Intelligence** program at **TU Delft**, with a keen interest in **AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Computer Vision**. I am currently involved in several research projects exploring the intersection of deep learning, vision-language models, and spatial reasoning.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at **Mahindra University**, India, and have published papers in top-tier conferences like IEEE COMPSAC and SNPD.
